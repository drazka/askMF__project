The aim of the app is checking VAT number of Polish companies at government website,
saving the output in csv/xls and on print screens. 
It would be useful when big amount of VAT numbers has to be checked (the website is without available API). 

Potential users of the app would be employeers of finance, 
VAT and accountant departments who are in charge of verifying VAT numbers (time-saving tool, helpful during VAT deduction process)
